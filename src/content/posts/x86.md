I had some forays into initial experiments with local LLMs and a 2d game engine but eventually shifted towards using the frontier models to get anything done.

The progress has been insane in the last three years and there's no further explaination other than we are in a large adventurous zone of contemplation.

Thus I am presenting a first iteration of my "game" that is a game.

At first it would not really create anything other then the raw skeleton of the game.

The ideal goal would be that the game is live and tested on a virtual environment in a full setup loop. Then launching it is simply a matter of putting on the sounds in place.

Still on the hunt for a decent pixel art generator.

The ironic thing about the story of an independent creator is that to gain attention the story is often riddled with how good of a life being an independent creator is, the story or attention is not necessarily on what they are creating but it's how they ended up where they were.

The independent creator often attracts interest regardless of the the product output or value because hey they are the hero of their own lives and have managed to do or achieve what 98% of others cannot, at least on their own.

The independent creators target market is other aspiring independent creators, their market is normies, they sell a desire to normies that their life is understated or less so because makers are creating value and normies are not. The second statement being untrue If in fact 98% of people can't create anything of value (possible), then it is also a reality that 99.9% of people would not function as an independent creator.

By posting island snapshots of working conditions they sell the desire is struck by some notion that the safety and regularity of the 9-5 is not right and that we rightful solo entrepreneurs.

The reality of an "indie" creator is more like a triangle of building influencer reputation, building scam apps, and posting about it on social media. Nothing against those who want to learn about technogolies by building and applying knowledge but there is a fine line between scam apps and build to learn.

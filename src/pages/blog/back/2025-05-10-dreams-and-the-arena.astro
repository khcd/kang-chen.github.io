Some people don't dream and are forever chained down into the most practicle route in life.
The goal of the education or state should be to allow people to execute some kind of self fulfillment that is nominally related to the conduct of 

some people dream but somehow they want other people to execute them and that's acceptable 

if you have a dream you have to be the number one fighter for your dream and be the hardest worker otherwise you won't be able to effectively recruit others into the mission. if you are a fighter for your said dream.

if you want a clean room you have to getup move around and pick things up these issues are the undeniable aspects of entropy human systems are held together by forces beyond our control.

therefore the largest hurdles remain if you need to done do it your and get it done today, something do it today.

if you want to build a product you have to sling code and pixels, and think about your product, regardless of the current state of AI. There are some basic foundations of work that need to be met to progress from A to B, some of which is possible to "shorten", some of which is not.

if you want to build muscle you need to lift weights

if you want to build endurance you need to run or swim, no way around it.

if you want to invest or trade you have to take positions, and therefore take on risk.

if you want to engage in art making you need to find a medium and produce artworks in that said medium be it painting, sculpture or anything else.

if you want to get better at skateboarding you need time on the board and to cultivate the ability to fall or to take hits.

if you want to write you need to put pen to paper, no ai is not going to make anyone a more effective writer, infact it's probably doing the opposite and soon many will loose the ability to write and to think for themselves which is kind of perfect for AI companies to further push adgenda that want to agenitise every facet of our lives, just as social media handicapped everyone's attention span. when pushing the rise of Ai agents or AI in general be very wary about those who are ultimately succeeding in the matter.

therefore it doesn't surprise me that the ceo of the largest AI company in the world, uses a pen and paper

all pain or much or pain and suffering comes from avoidance of real work, I think deep down think that people know what it is required to get from A to B, whether or not they want to go to that place of whats required is another question. 

when writing or another endevour is to avoid and seek gain
the funny notions of people ive met again and again are working or functioning adults who seem to think it's ok to borrow everything, and ask for help on the most trivial of topics, someone that turns up to band practice and needs to borrow a pedal board, and in borrowing the pedal board gets someone else to set it up, someone that needs to borrow your bike, without thinking in advance that the said bike has to be reset in order for it to be borrowed.

it's perfectly fine to go on in life like this as a child as an adult I do not think it is too acceptable to go on like this in adulthood except maybe borrowing the odd thing from your parents when there is an absolute necessity and or emergency.

circling back to the principal agent manifesto, it seems like everything may circle back to the principle agent manifesto.

One cannot escape the work, especially with anything that deals with issues on the creative front products, games, books, etc, films. yes and it is the small things which add up in these digital or physical products, a pixel here and a pixel there, it may seem like nothing the customer may not even feel it or realise it but it certainly shows in the final product in the form of spirit or "feel".

going into the principle agent problem, people will pitch the idea of principal but in effect what they want is an agent. We see it more and more with AI which are accordingly named agents. An agent doesn't decide it executes. From an inflection point the decision will be the hardest.

People see AI agents great, now they tranpose this to humans. I'm not sure if the case could be made.

Adult relationships are almost constantly in flux because of this principal agent problem, most of our adult relationships are based on work 

or put it this way if someone was to offer you a measly part of a likely billion dollar company would you take it? that's how vc's work. but not only that they actively work to justify market caps.

scramble suit was a basic requirement of nordic brain power in addition to the vast thus there's no alignment from the beginning. just a vast realm of meth psychosis in adverdant,

the drugs that ultimately cause brain damage are not without many short comings the dark, layabouts in terms of what would pay the bills and if coding paid the bills then he would go about and code more

why had phillip k dick indeed hit the core more

The final product being an outcome of blood sweat and drudgery, with occasional glimmers of "hope"

all knowledge and skill decay unless explitcity reinforced

I think we we split a client project first then go from there that would be fairly effective to gauge if we can work together,

then there are the dream sellers, yes it seems like it's an active role at the moment given the rise of social media

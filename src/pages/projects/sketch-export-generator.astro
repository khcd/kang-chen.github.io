				In 2015, Sketch was rapidly becoming the tool of choice for UI designers,
				but it had a frustrating limitation: exporting assets for both iOS and
				Android meant tedious, repetitive work. Each platform needed different
				sizes, different naming conventions, and different folder structures.
			</p>

			<p>
				Sketch Export Generator was born from that friction. A single keyboard
				shortcut—Shift + Option + Command + E—and suddenly you had all your
				export sizes configured for both platforms simultaneously.
			</p>

			<p>
				Built in collaboration with Philippe Hong, the plugin was a small utility
				that solved a real problem. It wasn't revolutionary, but it was useful.
				Thousands of designers added it to their workflow, and it continued
				receiving updates through Sketch 48.2.
			</p>

			<p>
				Eventually, Sketch added native multi-export features, making the plugin
				obsolete. That's the best outcome for any tool—when the platform absorbs
				the idea and you become unnecessary. It means you were solving a problem
				that needed solving.

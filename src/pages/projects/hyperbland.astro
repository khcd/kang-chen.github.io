			<p>
				Hyperbland began as an investigation into the limits of real-time rendering.
				The question was simple: how fast can we push computational geometry through
				WebGL before the browser gives up?
			</p>

			<p>
				Built on a modern Three.js boilerplate, the project became a playground for
				testing torus rotations, NURBS surfaces, and parametric line structures at
				various resolutions. What started as performance benchmarks evolved into
				something more interesting—accidental visual discoveries that emerged from
				pushing parameters beyond their intended ranges.
			</p>

			<p>
				The "yarn accidents" and "infinite jitter" variations weren't planned. They
				came from misconfigurations that produced unexpectedly beautiful results:
				strobing geometries, bloom structures cascading into themselves, and forms
				that seemed to breathe at the edge of frame-rate collapse.
			</p>

			<p>
				This project reinforced something I've come to believe: the most interesting
				creative work often happens at the boundary between control and chaos, where
				systems start to behave in ways their creators didn't anticipate.
